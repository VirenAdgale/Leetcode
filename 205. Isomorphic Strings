Given two strings s and t, determine if they are isomorphic.

Two strings s and t are isomorphic if the characters in s can be replaced to get t.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "egg", t = "add"

Output: true

Explanation:

The strings s and t can be made identical by:

Mapping 'e' to 'a'.
Mapping 'g' to 'd'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"

Output: false

Explanation:

The strings s and t can not be made identical as 'o' needs to be mapped to both 'a' and 'r'.

Example 3:

Input: s = "paper", t = "title"

Output: true


class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        
        int[] map1 = new int[256];
int[] map2 = new int[256];

for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

    char c1 = s.charAt(i);
    char c2 = t.charAt(i);

    if (map1[c1] != map2[c2]) {
        return false;
    }

    map1[c1] = i + 1;
    map2[c2] = i + 1;
}

return true;

    }
}
